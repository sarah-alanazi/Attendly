# Attendly

Idea: A system to track student attendance fairly and transparently using QR Codes and GPS.

Problem: Some university classrooms have glass barriers, and the instructor cannot properly verify attendance, allowing some students to register attendance for absent friends.

Solution:  
- Each student scans a QR code inside the classroom.  
- The system verifies their GPS location and links the account to a single device only.  
- Attendance statuses: 
  - ðŸŸ¢ Trusted  
  - ðŸŸ¡ Doubtful  
  - ðŸ”´ Absent  
- Students can submit objections with a live photo within 24 hours if there is an error in location tracking.  
- Instructor dashboard for reviewing attendance and objections.

My Role:  
- Designed the student interface and instructor dashboard layout.  
- Implemented the GPS and QR code verification logic.  
- Defined the attendance status rules and objection workflow.  
- Documented the project in this README and prepared the initial concept for GitHub.

Note: This is an initial repository to document the idea and establish project ownership. It will be updated as the project develops into a real application.
